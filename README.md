# fin-regression1
A simple regression-based project using financial data to predict asset price movements.
The project explores the predictive power of macroeconomic financial indicators on risk assets. 
It features several indicators, monthly closes of US stock indices, and leverages
regression techniques to explore the predictive power of the indicators. 
The end result is a logistic regression model used predict directional movement rather than magnitude.
The results may not be perfect, but they are informative and insightful in a holistic sense. For anyone familiar with 
risk markets and the macroeconomic environment, the results may seem obvious or simplistic, but for those less familiar, 
the project may provide somewhat of an educational view on the topic! I learned as I went along LOL
